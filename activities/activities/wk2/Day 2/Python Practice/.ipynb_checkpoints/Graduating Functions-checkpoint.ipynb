    "# Graduating Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, you will create a function that searches a list of students and graduates by state to determine state graduation rates for public, private nonprofit, and private for-profit institutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "* Analyze the code and CSV provided, looking specifically for what needs to still be added to the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using the starter code provided, create a function called `print_percentages` which takes in a parameter called `state_data` and does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Uses the data stored within `state_data` to calculate the estimated graduation rates in each category of Title IV 4-year institutions (public, non-profit private, and for-profit private).\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Prints out the graduation rates for each school type for the state to the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Some states do not have non-profit or for-profit private schools, so data must be checked for zeros\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bonus\n",
    "\n",
    "* Still within the `print_percentages()` function, calculate the overall graduation rate, and create a conditional that checks a state's overall graduation rate and prints either \"Graduation success\" to the screen if the number was greater than fifty or \"State needs improvement\" if the number was less than 50.\n",
