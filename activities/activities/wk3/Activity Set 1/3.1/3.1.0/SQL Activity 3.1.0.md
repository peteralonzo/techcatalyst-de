## **Exploring OLTP and Data Warehousing**

To understand the fundamental differences between Transactional Databases (OLTP) and Data Warehouses, and to identify when and why each is needed.

#### Introduction

- In this activity, we will explore the concepts of OLTP (Transactional Databases) and Data Warehousing.
- OLTP databases are used for transactional operations, while Data Warehouses are designed for analytical and reporting purposes.

#### Research and Discovery

1. **OLTP (Transactional Database):**

   - Research what OLTP is and its key characteristics.
   - Understand why organizations need OLTP.
   - Explore the pros and cons of OLTP databases.

2. **Data Warehousing:**

   - Research what a Data Warehouse is and how it differs from OLTP.
   - Explore why organizations need Data Warehouses.
   - Investigate the pros and cons of Data Warehouses.


**Group Discussion:**

- We will form small groups, and each group will present their findings to the class.
- Discuss the differences between OLTP and Data Warehousing, including use cases and scenarios where each is most suitable.

**Scenario Analysis**

- We will discuss real-world scenarios or business use cases.
- Consider which type of database (OLTP or Data Warehouse) would be more appropriate for each scenario and explain why.
