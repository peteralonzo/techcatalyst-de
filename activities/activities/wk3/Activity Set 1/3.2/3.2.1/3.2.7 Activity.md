The following query returns the number of suppliers in each region:

```sql
SELECT R_NAME, COUNT(*)
       FROM NATION N
       INNER JOIN REGION R ON R.R_REGIONKEY = N.N_REGIONKEY
       INNER JOIN SUPPLIER S ON S.S_NATIONKEY = N.N_NATIONKEY
       GROUP BY R_NAME;
```

Modify this query to use **case expressions** to pivot this data so that it looks as follows:
