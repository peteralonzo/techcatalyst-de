## 3.2.1 Activity Solution

## Exercise 8-1

Write a query against the `Nation` table that uses a subquery on the `Region` table to return the names of all nations except those in the America and Asia regions.

```sql
select n_nationkey, n_name 
       from nation
       where n_regionkey not in
        (select r_regionkey from region 
         where r_name in ('AMERICA', 'ASIA'));
```

or

```sql
select n_nationkey, n_name 
       from nation n
       where not exists
        (select 1 from region r 
         where r.r_regionkey = n.n_regionkey 
           and r_name in ('AMERICA', 'ASIA'));
```





## Exercise 8-2

Write a query against the `Customer` table that returns the `c_custkey` and `c_name` columns for all customers who placed exactly four orders in 1997. Use a subquery against the `Orders` table.

```sql
select c_custkey, c_name
       from customer
       where c_custkey in
        (select o_custkey
         from orders
         where date_part(year, o_orderdate) = 1997
              group by o_custkey
              having count(*) = 4);
```

or

```sql
select c_custkey, c_name
       from customer c
       where 4 =
        (select count(*)
         from orders o
         where date_part(year, o_orderdate) = 1997
           and o.o_custkey = c.c_custkey);
```

## Exercise 8-3

Write a query to count the number of rows in the `Supplier` table, along with determining the minimum and maximum values of the `s_acctbal` column.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*), MIN(S_ACCTBAL), MAX(S_ACCTBAL)
       FROM SUPPLIER;
```

## Exercise 8-4

Modify the query from Exercise 8-3 to perform the same calculations, but for each value of `s_nationkey` rather than for the entire table.

```sql
SELECT S_NATIONKEY, 
         COUNT(*), MIN(S_ACCTBAL), MAX(S_ACCTBAL)
       FROM SUPPLIER
       GROUP BY S_NATIONKEY;
```



## Exercise 8-5

Modify the query from Exercise 8-4 to return only those rows with more than 300 suppliers per `s_nationkey` value.

```sql
SELECT S_NATIONKEY, 
         COUNT(*), MIN(S_ACCTBAL), MAX(S_ACCTBAL)
       FROM SUPPLIER
       GROUP BY S_NATIONKEY
       HAVING COUNT(*) > 300;
```
